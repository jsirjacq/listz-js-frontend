## How to use

> Before creating a new `Listz`, you should ask the listz organisation to prepare a repository for you.

When adding a new [Listz](https://github.com/listz/listz#what-is-a-listz), start from this repository and edit the [listz.json](listz.json) so that it contains the content you want to add to the collection of `Listz`.

You can test if your `listz.json` is valid by running the `test` command:

```shell
npm run test
```
